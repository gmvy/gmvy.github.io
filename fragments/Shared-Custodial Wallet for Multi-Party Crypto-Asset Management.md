# Shared-Custodial Wallet for Multi-Party Crypto-Asset Management

## Introduction

Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is revolutionizing industries like supply chain management, banking, and healthcare by offering decentralized data integrity. Unlike traditional systems vulnerable to tampering, DLT relies on cryptographic key pairs to ensure security. This decentralization has fueled unprecedented growth in digital asset investments, prompting the need for specialized custodial services. Among these, **Multi-Party Computation (MPC) wallets** stand out as a solution to mitigate single points of failure in crypto-asset management.

As cryptocurrencies evolve, wealth managers face increasing pressure to balance security with user experience. Our **MPC-based shared-custodial wallet** addresses this challenge by distributing control among three parties: the client, wealth manager, and custody system. This architecture eliminates single points of failure while maintaining compliance with regulatory frameworks.

### Why This Matters
- **Security Enhancement**: Threshold cryptography prevents unauthorized access
- **Operational Efficiency**: Streamlined transaction policies for high-net-worth clients
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Built-in mechanisms for legal and compliance requirements

## Background

### Multi-Party Computation (MPC)

Developed by Andrew Yao in the 1980s, **MPC** allows multiple parties to compute functions without revealing individual inputs. In crypto wallets, this translates to distributed private key management. Unlike traditional single-signature wallets vulnerable to key compromise, **MPC wallets** divide keys into "shards" held by different parties.

**Key Benefits:**
- Eliminates single points of failure
- Enables collaborative transaction signing
- Supports threshold requirements (e.g., 2-of-3 approvals)

### Threshold Cryptography

Building on Blakley and Shamir's secret sharing concepts, threshold cryptography distributes cryptographic operations across multiple entities. Our implementation uses **Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS)**, allowing organizations to maintain a single public key while distributing signing authority.

This approach:
1. Prevents key misuse through distributed authorization
2. Enables cryptographic policy enforcement
3. Facilitates secure multi-party transactions

## System Architecture

Our **2-of-3 threshold MPC system** involves three key participants:
1. Client User
2. Wealth Manager User
3. Custody Platform

Each holds a key share generated through **Distributed Key Generation (DKG)**, requiring collaboration for transactions.

### Key Components

#### Client User
- Controls crypto assets via private key shares
- Participates in wallet creation and key recovery
- Manages transaction policies and signing

#### Wealth Manager
- Manages client portfolios securely
- Initiates and signs transactions within policy limits
- Ensures regulatory compliance

#### Custody System
- Facilitates key management coordination
- Verifies transaction compliance
- Provides secure communication interfaces

#### FAQ: How Does Threshold Cryptography Improve Security?
**A:** By distributing key shares across multiple parties, even if one entity is compromised, attackers can't access funds without additional key fragments. This eliminates single points of failure inherent in traditional wallets.

## System Operation

### Key Generation Process

Using **Distributed Key Generation (DKG)**, our system creates cryptographic key shards for all parties:
1. Independent key shard generation at each node
2. Cryptographic commitment verification
3. Public key derivation for wallet address

This decentralized approach ensures:
- No single entity ever holds the complete private key
- Enhanced resistance to both internal and external threats
- Elimination of trust assumptions required in Verifiable Secret Sharing

### Transaction Management

Our workflow combines security and efficiency:
1. Wealth manager initiates transaction
2. Backend generates transaction record
3. Wealth manager signs via key shard
4. Client/system completes second signature
5. Transaction broadcasts to blockchain

**Key Security Measures:**
- Policy-enforced transaction limits
- Cryptographically embedded whitelisting
- Real-time transaction monitoring

#### FAQ: What Happens During Key Recovery?
**A:** If a party loses access, our **Decentralized Recovery (DeRec)** protocol allows key shard restoration through helper nodes. The process includes:
- User/helper pairing with cryptographic authentication
- Encrypted share distribution with versioning
- Periodic verification to detect compromised nodes

## Threat Model

### Attack Scenarios

#### Individual Party Compromise
- Wealth manager key loss requires client/system approval for transactions
- Client shard compromise cannot initiate transfers alone
- Custody system shards lack transaction initiation capabilities

#### Joint Party Compromise
While two compromised shards could theoretically authorize transactions, our system mitigates risks through:
- Cryptographically enforced withdrawal limits
- Whitelisted address requirements
- Multi-party approval for policy changes

### Defense Mechanisms

#### Operation-Based Mitigations
- Fully distributed key generation and signing
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) layers
- Decentralized recovery protocols

#### Role-Based Protections
- Custody system cannot initiate transactions
- Policy enforcement through cryptographic commitments
- Transaction approval hierarchies

#### Time-Based Defenses
- Periodic key shard updates
- Helper node verification
- Proactive threat detection systems

## Business Model

### Value Proposition

Our **shared-custodial model** combines advantages from both custodial and non-custodial solutions:
| Feature | Traditional Custodial | Non-Custodial | Our Solution |
|--------|------------------------|---------------|--------------|

### Revenue Streams

1. **On/Off-Ramp Fees**: Service provider listings for fiat-crypto conversion
2. **Transaction Fees**: Token swaps and exchange integrations
3. **Management Fees**: Based on assets under management (AUM)
4. **Performance Fees**: For returns exceeding benchmarks
5. **Staking/Lending**: Revenue share from protocol rewards
