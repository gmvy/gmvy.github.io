# Stripe Acquires Crypto Wallet Developer Privy to Accelerate Digital Asset Expansion

The digital payments giant Stripe has made a strategic move to strengthen its position in the blockchain ecosystem. According to a Bloomberg report on June 11, 2025, Stripe has agreed to acquire cryptocurrency wallet infrastructure provider Privy, marking another major step in its digital asset strategy following the $1.1 billion acquisition of stablecoin infrastructure firm Bridge in October 2024.

## Strategic Expansion in Blockchain Infrastructure

This acquisition demonstrates Stripe's commitment to building comprehensive cryptocurrency solutions for businesses. By integrating Privy's embedded wallet technology with Bridge's stablecoin infrastructure, Stripe aims to create a unified platform for next-generation financial services that seamlessly connect crypto and traditional finance.

### Why Privy Matters

Privy, a New York-based startup founded in 2021, has developed cutting-edge embedded wallet solutions that enable businesses to integrate cryptocurrency capabilities directly into their applications. Key features of Privy's technology include:

- **Seamless Integration**: Eliminates the need for external wallet setup
- **NFT Compatibility**: Already deployed by platforms like OpenSea
- **Developer-Friendly API**: Simplifies blockchain integration for enterprises

With over $40 million in funding and a $230 million valuation as of March 2025, Privy's technology has proven its value in the market. Stripe CEO Patrick Collison emphasized the strategic importance of this acquisition:

> "Combining Privy's wallet solutions with Stripe's payment infrastructure and Bridge's stablecoin capabilities will enable us to deliver innovative global financial services that meet the evolving needs of businesses and consumers."

### Building a Stablecoin Ecosystem

The Privy acquisition follows Stripe's landmark $1.1 billion purchase of Bridge in 2024. Bridge's infrastructure powers stablecoin transactions for major clients including Coinbase and SpaceX, offering:

| Feature              | Bridge Capabilities              |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| Stablecoin Support   | USDC, USDB                       |
| Transaction Speed    | Instant cross-border transfers   |
| Cost Efficiency      | 50-80% lower fees vs traditional |
| API Integration      | Ready-to-deploy payment solutions|

This dual acquisition strategy positions Stripe as a comprehensive blockchain infrastructure provider, offering both wallet solutions and stablecoin transaction capabilities.
