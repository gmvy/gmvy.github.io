# How to Use BscScan: A Comprehensive Guide  

BscScan is the leading blockchain explorer for **Binance Smart Chain**, developed by the same team behind Etherscan. Beyond tracking transactions and verifying smart contracts, BscScan plays a critical role in validating the BSC network. This guide will walk you through its core features, practical applications, and how to maximize its utility for blockchain exploration and interaction.  

## What Is BscScan?  

BscScan functions as a **blockchain explorer** for Binance Smart Chain, offering transparency and accessibility to users. Similar to Etherscanâ€™s interface, it allows you to search wallet addresses, transactions, smart contracts, and network activity. Key features include:  

- **Transaction tracking** via transaction hashes or wallet addresses.  
- **Smart contract verification** to ensure code integrity.  
- **Validator rankings** for BSCâ€™s Proof-of-Staked-BNB consensus mechanism.  
- **Token tracking** for BEP-20 and ERC-721 tokens.

The platformâ€™s clean design prioritizes usability, making it beginner-friendly while offering advanced tools for developers. Unlike wallets, BscScan doesnâ€™t store private keys but integrates with external wallets like MetaMask and Trust Wallet.  

### Why BscScan Matters  
BscScanâ€™s value lies in its ability to demystify blockchain data. Whether youâ€™re verifying a transaction, auditing a contract, or tracking NFTs, BscScan provides actionable insights into the BSC ecosystem.

## How to Track Transactions on BscScan  

### Step 1: Locate a Transaction Hash or Wallet Address  
To track a transaction, youâ€™ll need its **transaction ID (hash)** or the **wallet address** involved. These can be found in your wallet app or exchange confirmation emails.  

### Step 2: Search on BscScan  
Enter the hash or address into BscScanâ€™s search bar. Results will display:  

- **Transaction status** (pending, successful, or failed).  
- **Block height** (when the transaction was recorded).  
- **BNB value** (converted to USD).  
- **Gas fees** (transaction cost).  
- **Private notes** (visible after logging into your BscScan account).  

### Example Transaction Breakdown  
| Detail              | Example Value              |  
|---------------------|----------------------------|  
| Transaction Status  | Successful                 |  
| Block Height        | #35,123,456                |  
| Value Sent          | 2.5 BNB (~$750 USD)        |  
| Gas Fee             | 0.0015 BNB (~$0.45 USD)    |

## Validator Rankings and Delegation  

Binance Smart Chain uses a **Proof-of-Staked-BNB** model, where 21 validators are elected based on their staked BNB. BscScan provides real-time data on validator performance, including:  

- **Staked BNB**: Total BNB delegated to the validator.  
- **Block Production**: Blocks validated in the last 24 hours, week, and month.  
- **APR Rewards**: Annual Percentage Rate for delegators.

### Top Validator Example  
| Validator Name | Staked BNB | APR     | Active Status |  
|----------------|------------|---------|---------------|  
| BscScan        | 745,525    | 13.8%   | Active        |  
| Validator X    | 500,000    | 14.2%   | Active        |  

Delegators can vote for validators by staking their BNB, earning rewards while supporting network security.

## Tracking BEP-20 and ERC-721 Tokens  

### BEP-20 Tokens  
BEP-20 is the native token standard on BSC, analogous to Ethereumâ€™s ERC-20. BscScan allows you to:  
- View token balances.  
- Track price, volume, and market cap.  
- Identify cross-chain compatibility.  

### ERC-721 Tokens (NFTs)  
BscScan supports ERC-721 tokens, enabling users to:  
- Verify ownership of NFTs.  
- Explore transaction history and contract interactions.  
- Cross-reference over 5,200 ERC-721 contracts.  

**Note**: While BscScan displays token IDs and transaction data, viewing NFT artwork requires connecting to a marketplace like OpenSea or Binance NFT.

## Verifying Smart Contracts  

Smart contract verification ensures the code on the blockchain matches the publicly shared version. Steps to verify:  
1. Navigate to the **Contract** tab on BscScan.  
2. Enter the contract address.  
3. Upload the Solidity source code and compiler settings.  
4. Confirm the code matches the on-chain version.  

This process enhances trust in decentralized applications (dApps) by proving transparency.

## BscScan and NFT Compatibility  

BscScan fully supports **ERC-721 tokens**, making it a go-to tool for NFT enthusiasts. To explore NFTs:  
- Search by **transaction hash** to view NFT transfers.  
- Use a **wallet address** to see all NFTs owned.  
- Check the **contract address** for details about a specific collection.  

While BscScan doesnâ€™t render NFT images, it provides metadata like token ID, project name, and transaction history.
