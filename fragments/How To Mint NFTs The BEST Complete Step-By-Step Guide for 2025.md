## Understanding NFTs: A Foundation for Success

Before diving into the minting process, it‚Äôs essential to grasp the fundamentals of **digital assets** and their blockchain underpinnings. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are unique cryptographic tokens representing ownership of specific digital items. Unlike fungible cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin), NFTs are indivisible and carry distinct metadata. Key features include:

- **Scarcity**: Limited supply models drive value.
- **Provenance**: Immutable blockchain records verify authenticity.
- **Royalty Mechanisms**: Creators earn passive income via secondary sales.

Blockchain platforms like **Ethereum**, **Binance Smart Chain**, and **Tezos** form the backbone of NFT ecosystems, each offering trade-offs in cost, speed, and sustainability.
