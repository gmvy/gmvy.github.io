# Coinbase's Market Debut: A Rollercoaster Ride Through Cryptocurrency History

## The Historic First Day: Market Cap Peaks at $100 Billion

On April 14, 2021, the cryptocurrency world witnessed a landmark event as Coinbase Global Inc. made its market debut on NASDAQ under the ticker COIN. The opening price of $381 set the stage for an unprecedented trading session, with the company's market capitalization instantly surpassing $99.6 billion. This milestone marked the first time a major cryptocurrency exchange achieved such valuation through a public market listing.

The stock price quickly surged to $429 within minutes of trading, pushing the market cap beyond $112 billion. However, the momentum couldn't be sustained, and the price eventually settled below the opening level, creating a volatile trading pattern that mirrored the cryptocurrency market itself.

**Key Financial Highlights:**
- Reference price: $250 (established by NASDAQ)
- Opening price: $381 (+52% premium)
- Intrady high: $429 (+71% gain)
- Closing price: $328.28 (-14% from opening)

## Company Evolution: From Startup to Industry Leader

Founded in 2012 by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam, Coinbase has grown from a simple Bitcoin wallet service to the largest cryptocurrency trading platform in the United States. The company's valuation trajectory closely follows cryptocurrency market cycles:

| Year | Valuation | Key Development |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| 2012 | $100,000  | Company inception |
| 2015 | $1.6 billion | Series C funding |
| 2018 | $8 billion  | Series E funding |
| 2021 | $100+ billion | Public market debut |

This exponential growth is driven by surging retail and institutional adoption of digital assets. As of Q1 2021, Coinbase serves 56 million verified users worldwide - a 74% increase from 32 million users in 2019.

- 2021 Q1: $1.8 billion revenue, $730-800 million net profit

This 800% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 2021 was primarily driven by the Bitcoin bull market, with BTC prices surging from $29,000 to $64,000 during the quarter. Monthly trading users (MTU) doubled from 2.8 million to 6.1 million in just three months.

1. Transaction fees (90% of total revenue)
2. Subscription and services
3. Other income sources
