## Understanding Bitcoin Gold (BTG)

### The Evolution of a Blockchain Pioneer

Launched in October 2017, Bitcoin Gold emerged as a fork of the Bitcoin protocol with a revolutionary vision for decentralized mining. By implementing the Equihash-BTG proof-of-work algorithm, BTG eliminated ASIC mining advantages, enabling standard GPU-based mining. This approach democratized cryptocurrency mining while maintaining Bitcoin's core strengths:

| Feature                | Bitcoin Gold (BTG)       | Bitcoin (BTC)          |
|------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Max Supply             | 21,000,000               | 21,000,000             |
| Block Time             | 10 minutes               | 10 minutes             |
| Mining Algorithm       | Equihash-BTG             | SHA-256                |
| ASIC Resistance        | Yes                      | No                     |
| Wallet Address Format  | Starts with 'G'          | Starts with '1'/'3'    |

### Core Innovations
- **Democratic Mining**: Enables standard PC hardware for mining operations
- **Decentralized Network**: Distributes mining power across global participants
