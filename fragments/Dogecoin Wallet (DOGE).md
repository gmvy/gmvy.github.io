## What is Dogecoin?  

Dogecoin (DOGE) began as a 2013 internet meme-based cryptocurrency but has evolved into a legitimate digital asset. Initially parodying Bitcoin, its community-driven ethos and Shiba Inu logo helped it gain mainstream traction. By 2021, DOGE surged in value amid social media hype, reaching nearly $0.70 per coin.  

### Key Characteristics of Dogecoin  
| Feature               | Description                                                                 |

| Supply                | Unlimited supply; miners earn 10,000 DOGE per block, leading to inflationary pressure. |  
| Use Case              | Designed for peer-to-peer transactions rather than long-term investment.     |  
| Community             | Active online community drives adoption and cultural relevance.             |  

While Dogecoinâ€™s inflationary model differs from Bitcoinâ€™s capped supply, its fast transaction speeds and low fees make it ideal for microtransactions. However, investors should approach it cautiously due to volatility.
