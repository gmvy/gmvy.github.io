# Cryptocurrency Investment Returns: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin Performance in H1 2025

## Market Overview: Key Drivers and Volatility

The first half of 2025 proved to be a rollercoaster for cryptocurrency investors, with Bitcoin (BTC) leading the market through unprecedented highs and corrections. Starting the year with a market capitalization surge to $3.64 trillion in January, the sector faced significant turbulence due to macroeconomic uncertainties. Global trade tensions initially triggered an 18.6% market contraction by March, but subsequent stabilization measures helped drive a 26% rebound in Q2.

### Bitcoin's Dominance and Market Sentiment

Bitcoin solidified its position as the crypto market leader, with its dominance rising from 56% to 64% in six months. This growing confidence in BTC came at the expense of altcoins (excluding Ethereum), whose market share dropped from 31% to 26%. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index maintained a consistent "Greed" reading of 66 throughout the period, reflecting sustained investor optimism despite price volatility.
