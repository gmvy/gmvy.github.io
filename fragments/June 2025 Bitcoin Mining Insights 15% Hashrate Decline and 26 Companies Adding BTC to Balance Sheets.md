# June 2025 Bitcoin Mining Insights: 15% Hashrate Decline and 26 Companies Adding BTC to Balance Sheets

## 15% Bitcoin Hashrate Decline Amid U.S. Summer Heatwave

The Bitcoin network experienced a significant 15% drop in computational power this June, marking the largest decline in three years. Initial hashrate stood at 942.6 million TH/s, falling to 799 million TH/s by month's end. This dramatic shift sparked speculation about potential causes, including geopolitical tensions and energy challenges.

While some analysts linked the decline to Israeli-Iranian conflicts affecting mining infrastructure, the primary driver appears to be America's summer heatwave. Electricity prices surged due to increased cooling demands, forcing marginal mining operations to temporarily shut down. This energy crisis highlights the environmental dependencies of Bitcoin mining operations.

### FAQ: Why does hashrate matter?
**Q:** What impact does hashrate decline have on Bitcoin?
**A:** Lower hashrate temporarily reduces network security and can slow transaction confirmations, though Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment mechanism eventually stabilizes block production.

## Cryptocurrency Security Breaches Cost $150 Million in June

TRM Labs reports that June 2025 saw $150 million in cryptocurrency losses due to sophisticated attacks. Year-to-date breaches now total $2.15 billion, surpassing 2024 figures by $500 million. The report identifies two primary attack vectors:

1. **Infrastructure attacks** (80% of losses): Targeting private keys, mnemonic phrases, and front-end systems
2. **Protocol attacks** (12% of losses): Exploiting blockchain vulnerabilities like flash loans and reentrancy bugs

### FAQ: Why do companies buy Bitcoin?
**Q:** What motivates corporate Bitcoin adoption?
**A:** Companies seek protection against fiat inflation, potential capital appreciation, and strategic diversification benefits.

Risk management firm Breed Capital warns that only companies with strong financial foundations can withstand potential Bitcoin price crashes. Their seven-step model predicts cascading liquidations during severe market corrections.
